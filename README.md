# Data Analytics: Basic-Methods
This repository contains the solution for CIND 123: Data Analytics: Basic Methods Assignment 2, focusing on Titanic data analysis, survival rates, and fare distributions. It includes probability analysis using Binomial and Poisson distributions, random sampling from normal distributions, and visualizing probability density functions in R.

In this assignment, I conducted data analytics using the Titanic Passenger Survival Data Set, exploring statistical methods and visualizations in R. I analyzed the dataset by creating a subset, calculating survival statistics for children, and examining passenger demographics by sex. I addressed missing age values and assessed survival rates by ticket class, using boxplots to visualize fare distributions. Additionally, I calculated the probability of a network of computers encountering software issues and estimated the likelihood of multiple computers facing problems with the Binomial distribution. I also simulated email reception patterns using Binomial and Poisson random variables and visualized their approximation. Finally, I generated random values from normal distributions, computed statistics for combined datasets, and plotted probability density functions while identifying the significance of the CDF value at 0.95. This assignment enhanced my skills in statistical analysis, probability theory, and data visualization as an aspiring data analyst.
